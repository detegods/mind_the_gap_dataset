# Detego Mind the Gap Datasets

The datasets contain (i) sales data from a online shop, (ii) sales data from brick-and-mortar stores, and (iii) fitting room data from a international fashion retailer. Specifically, it consists of shopping baskets (i.e., products that were bought together), and fitting baskets (i.e., products that were tried on together), as well as some additional metadata about the products. Note that the `TransactionId` can be used for grouping (i.e., generating baskets).
